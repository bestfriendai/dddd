# AsyncIO CancelledError Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing `asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError: Cancelled by cancel scope` errors in the FastAPI streaming endpoints. This error typically occurs when:

1. A client disconnects from a streaming endpoint before the stream completes
2. There are timeout issues with long-running operations
3. There are issues with task group management in async streaming

## Root Cause

The error was occurring in the `_astream_workflow_generator` function in `src/server/app.py`. When clients disconnected from the streaming endpoint or when operations took too long, the asyncio tasks were being cancelled but the cancellation wasn't being handled gracefully, leading to unhandled exceptions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Stream Generator

**File: `src/server/app.py`**

- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around the main streaming loop
- Added specific handling for `asyncio.CancelledError` exceptions
- Added graceful error reporting to clients via error events
- Implemented proper cleanup when streams are cancelled

### 2. Timeout Mechanism

**File: `src/server/app.py`**

- Added a timeout wrapper around the streaming response
- Configurable timeout via `STREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable
- Default timeout of 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- Graceful timeout handling with error messages to clients

### 3. Improved Prose Generation Endpoint

**File: `src/server/app.py`**

- Applied similar error handling to the `/api/prose/generate` endpoint
- Added cancellation handling for prose generation streams
- Improved error reporting for prose generation failures

### 4. Environment Configuration

**Files: `railway.toml`, `.env.example`, `.env.production`**

- Added `STREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` configuration option
- Set reasonable default values for production and development

## Key Changes

### Error Handling Pattern

```python
try:
    async for event in stream:
        try:
            # Process event
            yield result
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            logger.info("Stream cancelled")
            raise  # Re-raise for proper cleanup
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error processing event: {e}")
            yield error_event
            break
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    logger.info("Workflow stream cancelled")
    return  # Don't re-raise, it's expected
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception("Unexpected error")
    yield final_error_event
```

### Timeout Wrapper

```python
async with asyncio.timeout(timeout_seconds):
    async for chunk in stream_generator():
        yield chunk
```

## Benefits

1. **Graceful Client Disconnection**: When clients disconnect, the server handles it gracefully without logging errors
2. **Timeout Protection**: Long-running operations are automatically terminated after a configurable timeout
3. **Better Error Reporting**: Clients receive proper error messages instead of connection drops
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of resources when operations are cancelled
5. **Improved Logging**: Better distinction between expected cancellations and actual errors

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `STREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Timeout for streaming operations (default: 1800 seconds / 30 minutes)

### Railway Configuration

The timeout setting is automatically configured in Railway deployments via `railway.toml`.

## Testing

A test script (`test_fix.py`) was created to verify the error handling works correctly:

- Tests cancellation handling with timeouts
- Tests error handling in streams
- Verifies graceful cleanup

## Deployment Notes

1. The fix is backward compatible and doesn't require any API changes
2. Existing clients will benefit from improved error handling automatically
3. The timeout can be adjusted based on deployment requirements
4. No database migrations or configuration changes are required

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:

- Reduced `CancelledError` exceptions in logs
- Proper timeout behavior for long-running requests
- Client-side error handling improvements
- Overall stability of streaming endpoints

The fix should significantly reduce the occurrence of unhandled `CancelledError` exceptions while providing better user experience for clients using the streaming endpoints.
